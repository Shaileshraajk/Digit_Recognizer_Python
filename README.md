## Problem Statement:

The dataset is of 0-9 digits converted from image to input features, every row
represents a specific digit image along with labels for every row. You can view the image using Matplotlib if you wish to.
Design a project from the MNIST dataset to identify digit classification using any of the classification algorithms.
